## ðŸ§  How the AI Enhancement Works

### Q: How does uploading documents make the AI smarter?
**A:** When you upload documents, our system:
1. **Extracts text** from your files
2. **Breaks it into chunks** for better processing
3. **Creates connections** between related information
4. **Trains the AI** to reference your specific content
5. **Provides source-based answers** instead of generic responses

### Q: What's the difference between "Before" and "After" uploading documents?
**A:** 
- **Before**: Generic AI responses like "I don't have access to your specific information"
- **After**: Specific answers like "According to your return policy document, you offer 30-day returns with original receipt"

### Q: How long does it take for the AI to learn from my documents?
**A:** The learning process is immediate! As soon as your documents are uploaded and processed (usually 1-2 minutes), the AI can start providing enhanced answers.
